In this project, we argue from a data standpoint that, the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted to a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Specifically, we show that Florida counties with the highest new infections and consequent new deaths are those with the strongest vaccine hesitancy. We show that, following FDA approval of various vaccine for emergency use, the number of reported new cases and deaths within the state of Florida significantly dropped. We note a glaring spike in new cases, for the period running from end of June 2021, into the month of July 2021, and attribute this to vaccine hesitancy in most Florida counties. This period has one of the least numbers of new deaths in all counties, an indication that the vaccine is effective at preventing death. We conclude by predicting from the data trends that if all Florida residents were to be vaccinated, the number of new infections, hospitalization, and consequent deaths from COVID -19 will greatly diminish, and life may return to normal.
